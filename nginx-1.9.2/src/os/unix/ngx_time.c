/*
 * FreeBSD does not test /etc/localtime change, however, we can workaround it
 * by calling tzset() with TZ and then without TZ to update timezone.
 * The trick should work since FreeBSD 2.1.0.
 *
 * Linux does not test /etc/localtime change in localtime(),
 * but may stat("/etc/localtime") several times in every strftime(),
 * therefore we use it to update timezone.
 *
 * Solaris does not test /etc/TIMEZONE change too and no workaround available.
